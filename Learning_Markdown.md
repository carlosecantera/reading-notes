## Basics in Writing and Formatting in Syntax

1.**Headings**- *Headings can be created by typing a "#" before you type your text. The more "#" you have the smaller the text and the less "#" you have the bigger the heading will be

2.**Italics**- *Italics are made by using the "*" on each side of the text you are trying to use italics on. 

3.**Strike Through**- If you want to strike through text you would put "~~" on both sides of the text. This will generate a line through any text betweent he "~~"

4.**All Bold and Itlaics**- If you want your text to be in bold letters and also be in Italics you would use "***" before and after the text. 

5.**Quoting**- If you want to quote something you could use the ">" and it will indent and generate the quote. 

6.**Links**- To create a link you would use "[]" and "()". What you want the link to look like would be in the "[]" and the link to the website itself would be in the "()". 

7.**Emoji**-  To create an emoji within your text you would use ":" and then type the name pof the emoji in it. 

8.**Mentioning People or Group**- If you want to mention a specific person or group you would use the "@"followed by that person's name or the group's name.
