# *HTML Notes*
 ## **HTML Structuring**

 * Elements are made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag <>, </>.
 * <html>,</html>  anything between both of these are going to be code  
 * <body>,</body> is what is to be displayed on the page  
 * <h1>,</h1> is the main heading
 * <h2>,</h2> is a subheading
 * <p>,</p> is a paragraph
 * <title>,</title> allows you to add a URL
 *etc

 ### Attributes
 * On the opening of the tag you can include attributes.  These provide additional information for the contents fo the element.  You would first put an attribute name seperated by an "=" and then include the attribute value.
