# Links

## Writing Links

* Links are created by using < a >.  Everything that gives the user the ability to use the link goes inside the < a > element. 

**example** < a href="(the link)" > the text you want the user to see< /a >
When putting in where the customer will be sent be more specific instead of stating click here. 

## Directory Structure

Most websites should have a directory stucture or an organization by placing all code pages of different sections of the website in different folders.  These folders are generally called directories.

There are three different parts of the directory. 

 * Structure -This is the root folder where the whole project is kept
 * Relationship -This is the relationship between the main directory folder and the folders within that folder.
 * Homepages -This is written in HTML and its child folder is called index.html

## Other linking

* Email links -When linking in the < a > use "mailto:" and put the email in the quotations next to it 

* Linking to a specific par of the same page -An ID tag will need to be created so that you can have the link reference that portion of the page. Then after the ID had been place when referencing at the top use the < a href="# add the id">

* ID's - ID's are created when within the first heading element you type ID="" and put the name of the link you want to see.

#Layout

## Positioning Schemes

** There are 5 different positioning schemes.

- Normal Flow - psoition:static This allows for the block level elements to sit right on top of each other as to not take up the whole page.
- Relative Positioning - position:relative This allows for the positioning to be offest from the normal positioning.
- Absolute Positioning - position:absolute This allows the psotioning to be nearest to a specific family memeber.
- Fixed Positioning - position:fixed This allows for a scroll bar to be used.
- Floating Elements - float This allows you to "float" an portion of text offset of the main area.  You can determine how much spacing between your floats by clearing them on any side.

**It is important to know what kind of device is being used to view the site as the size of the screen may change the way it shows.**

# Functions, Methods, and objects

## What is a function

- **Function - A set of rules that are group together to complete a specific goal is called a function.**

## Declaring and Calling a function

- You start with the keyword of function and after fucntion you will type the name you want to call that cunction.  For example "funtion sendMail.  After that you have to put parenthsis and curly brackets.  Within the curly brackets is where you will put the code that is to be run.

- When calling the function you will use the name given to it with a parenthesis after it.  This will run that specific function.

## 6 reasons for pair programming

- It makes you more efficient.  Two people working on code together can learn from each other and catch mistakes before submitting code.
- It helps engage you with another person.
- As stated before it helps you learn from one another. Learning a new language is already stressful enough if you have someone to share knowledge with you are more likely to pick up things you might not know  
- It can help with social skills.  Learning to work with someone that doesn't think like you do may help you be more fluid in working with other people.  
- It allows you to learn to speak the language in a way that it will help with job interviews.
- It prepares you for the real world.  Lots of companies work in the manner of paired programmers and it is good practice to get you ready for it.
