## Teams

It has been studied that teams generate better products, solutions, and work wuicker than just individuals alone.

Ultimately what was found was that a successful team was based on how each team memebr treated one another.  Each team memeber gets an equal amount of time to talk and no one person taks more than another. The team memebers were also able to determine how another team member felt based on their tone of voice and could adjust accrodingly.
