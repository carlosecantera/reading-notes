## Positioning Schemes

** There are 5 different positioning schemes.

- Normal Flow - psoition:static This allows for the block level elements to sit right on top of each other as to not take up the whole page.
- Relative Positioning - position:relative This allows for the positioning to be offest from the normal positioning.
- Absolute Positioning - position:absolute This allows the psotioning to be nearest to a specific family memeber.
- Fixed Positioning - position:fixed This allows for a scroll bar to be used.
- Floating Elements - float This allows you to "float" an portion of text offset of the main area.  You can determine how much spacing between your floats by clearing them on any side.

**It is important to know what kind of device is being used to view the site as the size of the screen may change the way it shows.**
