## Tables

## Basic Table Stucture

- To create a table use the < table > element open and closed
- Within the table element use < tr > known as table row by each number you want in the table.  This builds the table horizontal.
- Each cell of a table is represented using the < td> element 


## Table headings

- < th > or table headings allows you to put headings above the different table information.  You can determine if it goes in a row or column by using the scope="" and enter either row or column to tell it in which direction it goes.

## Long Tables

- To create a long table you want to use a table head < thead >
- The body of the table should sit inside th < tobody >
- The footer of the table is set to < tfoot >

## Functions, Methods, and objects

## What is a function

- **Function - A set of rules that are group together to complete a specific goal is called a function.**

## Declaring and Calling a function

- You start with the keyword of function and after fucntion you will type the name you want to call that cunction.  For example "funtion sendMail.  After that you have to put parenthsis and curly brackets.  Within the curly brackets is where you will put the code that is to be run.

- When calling the function you will use the name given to it with a parenthesis after it.  This will run that specific function.

- Declaring functions that need information - put the paremeters in the parenthsis. Then return the parameters in the curly brackets.

## What is an Object

- An object is the result of variables ane functions grouped together to create something that is recognizable.

- When variable is in an objecct it is then considered a property.  The property explains what the object is  

- When the functions are part of an object, they are renamed methods.  Methods are tasks that are associated with that object.

# Domain modeling

- Domain modeling is a way for information from a source and turn it into metrics.
- An example would be how many people have watched a specific video.  A specific video cn be broken down into what the video is about by creating an object using this. and then taming the object
- Creating a function will be needed in order to run the code that will guage how many people have looked at that specific video.
- You can continue to create a similar function by adding new to that object and naming it with a descriptor for that object.
